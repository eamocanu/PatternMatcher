An experiment in pattern matching with neurons.

Run MainUi.java from package main.

Enter characters in the input box and see how the neurons change their dendrite values to match the input. Observe their learning process.

Input characters allowed: only 'a'-'z' or 'A'-'Z'


Future work is to leverage this code and apply it to image recognition.
